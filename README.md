# Airbnb-Rating-Prediction-Model
This project builds a predictive model to estimate whether an Airbnb listing will earn a perfect rating. Using listing, host, and review data combined with crime statistics and topic modeling on guest reviews, the analysis uncovers key factors driving guest satisfaction and pricing power.

## Project Overview
This project builds a predictive model to estimate whether an Airbnb listing will receive a perfect five-star rating. By analyzing listing metadata, host attributes, review history, and external crime statistics, the model identifies the key factors that influence guest satisfaction, visibility, and pricing power.

## Tools & Techniques
* Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn

* Topic Modeling for text feature extraction from guest reviews

* Feature Engineering using structured and unstructured data

* Classification Models for rating prediction

* Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
